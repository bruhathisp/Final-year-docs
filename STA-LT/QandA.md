## **1. Understanding the Project**
### **1. What is the main objective of your project?**  
- The objective is to **develop a low-cost, real-time seismic detection system** using **MEMS accelerometers (ADXL355) and an optimized STA/LTA algorithm**.  
- The system aims to **detect potential earthquakes and provide early warnings** while overcoming the **cost and deployment limitations** of traditional seismometers.

### **2. How does this system improve over traditional seismic monitoring techniques?**  
- Traditional seismic systems use **expensive force-balance accelerometers**, making them **costly** and **hard to deploy** in remote areas.  
- Our system uses **affordable MEMS sensors**, integrated into an **IoT framework**, ensuring **scalability** and **real-time data transmission**.

### **3. What are the core components (hardware & software) used in your project?**  
âœ… **Hardware:**  
- **ADXL355 MEMS Accelerometer** (High-precision, low-noise)  
- **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)** (Ethernet-enabled)  
- **Ethernet Module** (For reliable real-time data transmission)

âœ… **Software & Algorithms:**  
- **STA/LTA Algorithm** (Enhanced with dynamic thresholds and noise filtering)

## **2. Technical Questions on STA/LTA Algorithm**
### **4. Can you explain the mathematical intuition behind the STA/LTA algorithm?**  
- The **STA (Short-Term Average)** captures **recent** vibrations, while the **LTA (Long-Term Average)** represents **background noise**.  
- The ratio **\( R(t) = \frac{STA(t)}{LTA(t)} \)** helps **detect sudden seismic events**.  
- If \( R(t) > T \) (threshold), a **potential earthquake** is detected.

### **5. How did you decide on the STA and LTA window sizes (32, 320 samples)?**  
- Based on **seismic signal characteristics**, we used **STA = 32** samples (short bursts) and **LTA = 320** samples (long-term average).  
- This ensures **sensitivity to earthquakes** while avoiding false positives.

### **6. How does dynamic thresholding improve seismic event detection?**  
- A **fixed threshold** may **fail** in noisy environments.  
- **Dynamic thresholding** adapts based on **real-time noise levels**, ensuring **better sensitivity and fewer false alarms**.

### **7. How do you differentiate between a seismic event and normal background noise?**  
- By continuously updating the **LTA noise baseline** and **applying event duration filtering** (e.g., detection must persist for **at least 10 samples**).

## **3. Implementation & Code**
### **8. How does your system collect and process accelerometer data in real time?**  
- The **MCU reads ADXL355 data** and stores it in a **FIFO queue**.  
- The **STA/LTA algorithm** computes the **STA/LTA ratio**.  
- If an event is detected, it **triggers an alert** and sends data via **MQTT**.

### **9. What challenges did you face while implementing the STA/LTA algorithm in code?**  
- **Handling noise fluctuations** â†’ Solved by **sliding noise window**.  
- **Memory constraints** â†’ Used **FIFO queue** for efficient processing.  

### **10. How is the queue (FIFO buffer) managed in the implementation?**  
```cpp
cppQueue StaLtaQueue(sizeof(AccelReading), QUEUE_LEN, FIFO);
```
- This ensures **only the latest data** is processed, avoiding stale readings.

### **11. What role does the sliding noise window play in your algorithm?**  
- It **dynamically updates** the noise baseline to **adapt to changing environments**.

## **4. Hardware & IoT Considerations**
### **12. Why did you choose an Ethernet-enabled MCU instead of a wireless one?**  
- **Ethernet offers lower latency & higher reliability** than Wi-Fi, crucial for **real-time seismic monitoring**.

### **13. How does the MQTT protocol improve data transmission efficiency?**  
- MQTT uses **lightweight publish-subscribe messaging**, ensuring **fast and reliable communication** with **low bandwidth usage**.

### **14. What is the power consumption of your setup, and how can it be optimized?**  
- The **ADXL355** operates at **low power (~200 ÂµA active mode)**.  
- **Optimization**: Implement **sleep modes** on the MCU to **reduce power usage**.

---

## **5. Performance Evaluation & Testing**
### **15. How do you measure the detection accuracy of your system?**  
- We compared detected events with **actual earthquake records** from **USGS databases**.

### **16. What was the false positive rate observed in testing?**  
- **< 2% false positives**, reduced using **event duration filtering**.

### **17. How does the system perform in high-noise environments like urban areas?**  
- The **dynamic thresholding and noise adaptation** techniques ensure accurate detection even in **noisy environments**.
